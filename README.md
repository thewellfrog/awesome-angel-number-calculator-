## How to Calculate Your Angel Number

### Birthday Method (Life Path Number)
1. Write your full birthdate (MM/DD/YYYY)
2. Add all digits together
3. Reduce to a single digit (or master number 11, 22, 33)

**Example:** December 15, 1990 = 1+2+1+5+1+9+9+0 = 28 = 2+8 = **10** = 1+0 = **1**

### Name Method (Expression Number)
1. Assign each letter a number (A=1, B=2... Z=26)
2. Add all letters in your full birth name
3. Reduce to a single digit (or master number)

## Why Do I Keep Seeing the Same Numbers?

Repeatedly seeing the same number sequence is considered a sign from your guardian angels. Common places to spot angel numbers:
- Digital clocks (11:11, 3:33, 4:44)
- Receipts and price totals
- License plates
- Phone numbers
- Addresses
- Page numbers

When you notice these patterns, pause and reflect on your current thoughts and situation—the number's meaning may relate to what you're experiencing.
